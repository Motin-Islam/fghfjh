T(n) = T(0) + T(n-1) + \theta(n)
which is equivalent to  
 T(n) = T(n-1) + \theta(n)
The solution of above recurrence is \theta(n2).

Best Case: The best case occurs when the partition process always picks the middle element as pivot. Following is recurrence for best case.

 T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \theta(n)
The solution of above recurrence is \theta(nLogn). It can be solved using case 2 of Master Theorem.

Average Case:
To do average case analysis, we need to consider all possible permutation of array and calculate time taken by every permutation which doesn’t look easy.
We can get an idea of average case by considering the case when partition puts O(n/9) elements in one set and O(9n/10) elements in other set. Following is recurrence for this case.

 T(n) = T(n/9) + T(9n/10) + \theta(n)
Solution of above recurrence is also O(nLogn)

Although the worst case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n2) which is more than many other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort, QuickSort is faster in practice, because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures, and in most real-world data. QuickSort can be implemented in different ways by changing the choice of pivot, so that the worst case rarely occurs for a given type of data. However, merge sort is generally considered better when data is huge and stored in external T(n) = T(0) + T(n-1) + \theta(n)
